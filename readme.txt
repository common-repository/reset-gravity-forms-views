This plugin will automatically all views for Gravity Forms, on a regular basis.

== Description ==
Did you ever get frustrated by seeing all the views of your gravity forms in WordPress? This frustration could be caused by a huge reason:
- You're moving your site, and now your database is cluttered with this extra info
- People you work with confuse these with the real numbers, instead of looking at Google Analytics. (You, of course, never do that!)

Well, look no further! Just install the plugin, configure the frequency, and voila -- it will reset all views as often as you want it to.

2. Unzip it
3. Activate the plugin
4. Go to Settings -> Clear Debug Log Cron and configure the frequency.
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Magic happens!
